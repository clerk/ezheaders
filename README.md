## Introduction
Enjoy a more readable API with `header()` and `cookie()` - no more juggling intermediate variables or extra parentheses when handling `await`.
Plus, a way to use `headers` and `cookies` as variable names without renaming the NextJS APIs upon import.

This tiny monorepo contains the code for `ezheaders` - for details docs about `ezheaders`, refer to the [ezheaders README](./packages/ezheaders/README.md).
